# Description

This repository contains the code for the project on "Analysis of Grain and Seed Oil Production in Ukraine Prior to Recent Russion Invasion". This project
resulted in a paper which was submitted to the IBDAP 2022 conference.

## Project Goal

The goal of the project was to identify the most suitable machine leanring algorithm to predict the production level of grain or seed oil in Ukraine.

## Methods & Tools Used

There were two parts to this project. The first part is the exploratory data analysis that gave us insights into which variables have (or don't have) influence on the amount of grain and seed oil being produced in Ukraine in a year. There were three components of the EDA: i) data preprocessing - understanding the data and dealing with the missing/null values in the table(s), ii) identifying outliers - are the numerical variables in the data set (close to being) normally distributed or are they highly skewed? and iii) correlation analysis/heatmap - how correlated are the predictor variables to the dependent variable (production) and to each other? The last component of EDA is how the first part of the project segued into the second part. This is because the correlation heatmap created the ground for Feature Selection because the data is input into the machine learning models. The second part of the project was actually building and testing different machine learning models. Three linear models (multivariable reg., lasso reg., ridge reg) and three non-linear models (decision tree, random forest, kNN) were trained and tested. Each model was run for 1000 iterations (with 1000 different train-test splits of the same input data) and the average testing error was taken at the end.

## Results

Lasso Regression was found to be the best performing model out of the six, as it had both the smallest training and testing errors. 

## How Is This Project Useful?

An immediate use would be to use the lasso regression model as discussed in this paper to predict the production value of each of the four commodities (wheat, barley, corn and sunflower seed oil)for the year 2022 (if the values of predictor variables are known for the year 2022). One can then compare the predicted results with the official USDA figures and the difference/deficit could give us the idea of the impact the invasion by Russia has had on Ukraineâ€™s production of its primary commodities. 

A long-term use would be to expand on the framework of this project. This could mean using a larger dataset (for example using quarterly grain production data instead of yearly data). One could also add more independent variables to the data set such as precipitation, humidity and fertilizers. Then, repeat the process of building and comparing the performances of difference ML models using this new data set. This would give the highest-performing ML model which can then be used as a tool to predict production amount of a commodity for the next/current marketing year. These steps can be generalized to other countries.
